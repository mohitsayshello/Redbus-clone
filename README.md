# Redbus-clone
ðŸŒ¸ Redbud Clone Project
I'm built a Redbud website clone using pure HTML and CSS to recreate its design and layout. This project is a great exercise in responsive design, layout structuring, and learning the intricacies of styling. My goal is to achieve pixel-perfect accuracy and bring all elements to life without JavaScript. Check out my repo for the code and project updates!
